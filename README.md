# Python Learning 30 Days

Welcome to **Python Learning 30 Days** – a guided, hands-on roadmap designed to take you from beginner to advanced Python concepts in just 30 days. This repository contains lesson plans, exercises, projects, and resources that you can follow day-by-day to build your Python skills.

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive learning guide for Python, structured into 30 days of focused lessons. Each day covers a specific set of topics along with practical exercises and mini projects to reinforce what you learn. Whether you're new to programming or looking to deepen your Python expertise, this roadmap is designed to help you grow your skills systematically.

## Roadmap

Below is a summary of the 30-day plan:

- **Day 9: Functions – Basics**
  - Define and call functions with parameters and return values
  - Understand variable scope and practice with simple examples
- **Day 10: Mini Project #1**
  - Build a command-line calculator or a simple text-based game using topics from Days 1–9

### **Days 11–20: Intermediate Concepts**

  - Explore lambda functions, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`
  - Practice creating short, anonymous functions
- **Day 15: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Part 1**
  - Define classes and create objects
  - Understand attributes and methods with simple examples
- **Day 16: OOP – Part 2**
  - Dive into inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism
  - Create a small class hierarchy (e.g., an Animal class and its subclasses)
- **Day 17: Exception Handling**
  - Learn to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks
  - Handle common errors and practice debugging simple code errors
- **Day 18: Package Management & Virtual Environments**
  - Install external packages using `pip`
  - Set up and use virtual environments to manage dependencies
- **Day 19: Working with APIs & JSON**
  - Send HTTP requests using the `requests` module
  - Parse JSON data from public APIs
- **Day 20: Web Scraping Basics**
  - Use `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape data from websites
  - Build a small script to extract and display information

### **Days 21–30: Advanced Topics & Capstone Project**
- **Day 21: Decorators**
  - Understand how decorators modify function behavior
  - Write your own simple decorators (e.g., for logging function calls)
- **Day 22: Generators & Iterators**
  - Learn to write generator functions using the `yield` keyword
  - Practice iterators to handle large data streams efficiently
- **Day 23: Concurrency – Threads & Multiprocessing**
  - Explore multithreading and the multiprocessing module
  - Write simple concurrent programs to improve performance
- **Day 24: Asynchronous Programming**
  - Learn async/await syntax and the `asyncio` library
  - Write basic asynchronous scripts for I/O-bound tasks
- **Day 25: Unit Testing**
  - Write tests using `unittest` or `pytest`
  - Ensure your code is robust with automated tests
- **Day 26: Debugging & Profiling**
  - Use debugging tools like `pdb` to troubleshoot your code
  - Profile your scripts to identify performance bottlenecks
- **Day 27: GUI Programming with Tkinter**
  - Build a basic GUI application (e.g., a calculator or form)
  - Understand event-driven programming
- **Day 28: Web Development with Flask**
  - Set up a simple Flask application
  - Create routes and render templates for dynamic content
- **Day 29: Data Analysis with NumPy & Pandas**
  - Learn NumPy basics for numerical operations
  - Use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis on sample datasets
- **Day 30: Capstone Project**
  - Integrate topics from previous days (e.g., file I/O, web scraping, APIs, OOP, web development, or data analysis)
